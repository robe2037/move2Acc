# Merge adjacent bursts in an IMU vector

For a given IMU vector, identify temporally adjacent bursts and merge
them into a single burst. Bursts that end at the same time as the start
time of the next burst are considered adjacent. Bursts with different
frequencies or axes will not be merged.

## Usage

``` r
merge_imu(x, ids = NULL, drop = FALSE)
```

## Arguments

- x:

  An IMU vector (e.g. `acc`, `mag`, `gyro`).

- ids:

  Vector indicating groups to which the elements in `x` belong. If
  provided, bursts in `x` will not be merged across different values of
  this vector, even if their timestamps and frequencies align.

- drop:

  Logical indicating whether to drop entries that have been merged into
  other bursts. If `drop = FALSE` (default), the output will have the
  same length as the input `x`, with `NA` values at positions where
  bursts were merged into a preceding burst. This is useful for
  retaining index matching between the input and output vectors.

## Value

A vector of the same class as `x`.

## Examples

``` r
a <- acc(
  list(cbind(X = 1:60, Y = 1:60), cbind(X = 61:100, Y = 61:100), cbind(X = 101:140)),
  frequency = units::set_units(20, "Hz"),
  start = as.POSIXct(c(0, 3, 5), tz = "UTC")
)

merge_imu(a)
#> <acceleration[3]>
#> [1] (50.5 50.5) <NA>        (120.5)    
#> # frequency: 20 [Hz]
```
