# Mapping acceleration data

In this vignette we will show how you can create an interactive map of
an animal track where acceleration measurement at linked to the
positions where the animal has been recorded.

Lets first get example data, here we download the tracks of two
albatrosses.

``` r

library(move2Acc)
require(dplyr, quietly = TRUE)
require(move2, quietly = TRUE)
require(leaflet, quietly = TRUE)
albatross_data <- movebank_download_study(
  "Galapagos Albatrosses",
  individual_local_identifier = c("4264-84830852", "4266-84831108"),
  sensor_type_id = c("acceleration", "gps")
)
```

Next we create a `acceleration` column in the `move2` object

``` r

albatross_data <- albatross_data %>%
  mutate(acceleration = as_acc(.))
```

In the `move2` object accelerations are not connected to the location
observations. Therefore we need to match the acceleration measurements
to the location records. For these eobs tags we see that the
acceleration measurements are recorded after the location has been
recorded. Here we can use that with
[`dplyr::left_join()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/mutate-joins.html)
to find the associated records. An alternative would be to do a linear
interpolation of the location to the time of the acceleration
measurement using
[`move2::mt_interpolate()`](https://bartk.gitlab.io/move2/reference/mt_interpolate.html).

``` r

merged_data <- albatross_data |>
  filter(!sf::st_is_empty(geometry)) |>
  select(-acceleration) |>
  left_join(
    albatross_data |>
      select(eobs_start_timestamp, acceleration) |>
      filter(!is.na(acceleration)) |>
      sf::st_drop_geometry(),
    join_by(
      closest(eobs_start_timestamp < eobs_start_timestamp),
      individual_local_identifier == individual_local_identifier
    ),
    suffix = c(".gps", ".acceleration")
  )
hist(
  as.numeric(merged_data$timestamp.acceleration - merged_data$timestamp.gps,
    units = "secs"
  ),
  main = "Time difference between gps acceleration",
  xlab = "Time difference [seconds]"
)
```

In this histogram we see that there is generally only a few seconds
between the acceleration measurements and the gps record. Only on rare
occasions it is more then 10 seconds.

Now we can use the merged data to plot a map:

``` r

pal <- colorFactor("Set1", mt_track_id(albatross_data))
accRange <- quantile(
  unlist(vctrs::field(merged_data$acceleration, "bursts")),
  probs = c(.0001, .9999)
)
leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addPolylines(
    data = mt_track_lines(albatross_data |>
      filter(!sf::st_is_empty(geometry))),
    color = ~ pal(individual_local_identifier)
  ) %>%
  addCircleMarkers(
    data = merged_data, 
    color = ~ pal(individual_local_identifier),
    popup = leafpop::popupGraph(
      mapply(
        function(x, range) {
          dygraphs::dyAxis(x, name = "y", valueRange = unname(range))
        },
        mapply(plot_time, merged_data$acceleration,
          merged_data$timestamp.acceleration,
          SIMPLIFY = FALSE
        ),
        MoreArgs = list(range = accRange),
        SIMPLIFY = FALSE
      ),
      "html", height = 350, width = 600
    )
  ) %>%
  addLegend(
    pal = pal,
    values = mt_track_id(albatross_data)
  )
```
